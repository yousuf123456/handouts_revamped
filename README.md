# Project Description

So have you ever heard that creating a multi vendor ecommerce web is one of the difficult categories on the web to build ? Not sure about you but I did, so I decided to challenge myself and go beyond using django and simple js to build a fullstack functional multivendor ecommerce website just like **Amazon** OR **ETSY**.

# Distinctiveness

This multivendor e-commerce website surpasses the Commerce project and other projects in CS50W with its scalability for multiple vendors, comprehensive product catalog, sophisticated reviews and ratings, intricate inventory management, streamlined order fulfillment, personalized user experiences, stringent security measures, cutting-edge technologies, and a user recommendation system. These features highlight the complexity and advanced functionality of my project, showcasing my expertise in developing sophisticated web applications.

# Technologies Used

It I used the most cutting edge technologies for this like, **NextJs** for frontend and backend, **MongoDB** as my main Database, **Prisma** as the ORM to easily communicate with the database. I am using **Google Drive SDK** for the image uploads and many more technologies and packages to build up this amazing ecommerce webiste.

# Folder Structure

All the main code is inside the **app** folder. Inside the **app** folder the **api** folder contains all the backend apis. **actions** folder contains different database mutation actions. **assets** contains some data files. **components** folder have all the React components that are shared accross multiple pages. **constants** conatain data which is not dynamic. **hooks** conatin some react hooks. **types** flder conatain Typescript types interfaces for the app data. **Utils** folder have some utility functions. All the other folders represents the pages of the web app which contain respective React components files which make up a whole page.

# Running of the app.

This website is hosted on vercel. You can visit (handouts-six.vercel.app) to view the website. It is totally responsive so you can also visit it using mobile.
